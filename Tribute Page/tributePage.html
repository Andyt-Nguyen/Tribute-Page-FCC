			  <p>"Of Monsters And Men" was formed in 2009 and they are categorized as 'indie folk pop'.
			    Their first album <i>"My Head Is An Animal"</i> was developed in 2011. This album
			    has a very folky feel to it, I say this not because there categorized as folk, but in
			    their future album "Beneath The Skin" it has no folky-ness to it at all.
			    Anyways "My Head Is An Animal" has a ton of story telling and quite frankly,
			    that is what really separates them from a lot of bands that we hear on the radio.
			    The lyrics within every song has a fictional story incorporated in it such as animals,
			    kings, queens, monsters etc. which makes the songs really awesome to listen and visualize to.
			    <i>"Beneath The Skin,"</i> their second album, took a different direction from that album. It has more
			    of a darker ambiance to it. This album is about self-development, dealing with anxeity, and
			    fighting the need to change who you are to fit in society; other than that still a pretty damn good album.
			    If you like to know more about this awesome band checkout their
			     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/OfMonstersAndMenVEVO" target="_blank">Youtube</a> channel
